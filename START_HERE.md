## üé§ Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch

**Memorize this:**

> "I worked on a research project that integrated HR data from SAP HANA Cloud on BTP to Azure Synapse Analytics using Fivetran. The goal was to enable centralized analytics without building custom ETL pipelines. I configured both source and target systems, set up the Fivetran connector, and established automated batch synchronization every 6 hours. The project handled 6 HR tables and demonstrated end-to-end cloud-to-cloud data integration with proper security measures like SSL/TLS encryption and service accounts."

**Practice this 5 times before your interview!**
